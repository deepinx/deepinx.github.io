## About 

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

My goal is to use mathematical methods to solve practical problems in industrial practice. I am very interested in image processing, signal processing and artificial intelligence. I hope that through my efforts, more excellent algorithms in academia can be applied to actual products and contribute value to society.


## Research Interest

- Face analysis
- Face recognition
- Biomedical signal processing
- Deep learning
