## About 

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

My goal is to find solution to real world problem using computer vision and signal processing techniques. I am recently focusing on developing fundamental and practical algorithms for face related systems including detection, alignment, recognition, analysis and anti-spoofing, etc.


## Research Interest

- Face analysis
- Face recognition
- Biomedical signal processing
- Deep learning
